# SNEKS n LADDERS
***The classic Snakes and Ladders board game, reimagined!***

## Planned features:
- **Classic play:** play a classic game of Snakes and Ladders just like you remember it without the fluff!
- **Custom rules:** Change the rules of the game to match your dice rolling skill level! Whether you want more snakes, more ladders, no ladders at all, or even hidden snakes or morphing levels! You can even change the goal of the game entirely!
- **Multiple boards:** Choose to play on a variety of different boards with wildly differing layouts and branching paths that may require you to make more strategic decisions!
- **Power-ups:** Power up your game by collecting items as you make your way through the board. These can range from short passive buffs to traps that are just waiting to be unleashed at just the right moment and many more!
- **Online play:** Any game is more fun with friends! Connect to your friends online and duke it out to settle who's paying for dinner once and for all ;)
- **Gorgeous design:** As if that wasn't enough already, you're just gonna fall in love with how the game will look and how smooth the animations will be!
